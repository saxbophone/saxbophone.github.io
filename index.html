      <h1>Who</h1>
      <p>I am a <abbr title="20 year old">young</abbr> software developer working in London. I&apos;ve been programming since I was 15, professionally since I was 19 and am mostly self-taught.</p>

      <h1>What</h1>
      <p>I mainly do web application development for work, but in my spare time I tend to be more application/system programming focused. I&apos;m currently working on a number of side-projects, some as libraries, others as tools for me to be creative, all for my own personal amusement.</p>

      <h1>Why</h1>
      <p>I am really geeky! :) I&apos;ve always been fascinated with computers and have always wanted to know how they work. I love to know about the really absurdly deep details of how computers work and since trying out Linux, I have also become rather fond of Unix too!</p>
